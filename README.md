# yelp_stars_prediction
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying Yelp text reviews into star ratings (1-5) using multiple supervised learning models, ranging from traditional classifiers to more advanced deep learning architectures. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard helps visualize the models' results.
